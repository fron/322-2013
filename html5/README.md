[- NOTES FROM SECOND ASSIGNMENT:

In this assignment I learned the basics of HTML5:

The information contained in the web site: "Dive into HTML5" is quite extensive but very informative.
I complemented my new knowledge with Andrew's manual.

I modified my web site to include the tags: SECTION, NAV, ASIDE, HEADER, and FOOTER as required. I also created a web page with examples of using the mentioned tags. I included a temporal option in my web site: HTML5 examples, which will be present solely by this week.
