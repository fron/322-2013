[- NOTES FIRST ANDROID ASSIGNMENT:

In this assignment I installed Android SDK and Eclipse, it installed automaticaly the tools, and platform-tools directory.

I located Android under the Program Files directory.

I added the path for both: tools, and platform-tools.

The variable name was not really necessary.

Once I run: android sdk, the SDK Manager showed up, from there, under the tab "tools" I executed AVD, and the Android Virtual Manager showed up.

I created a virtual device: androidTest.

I launched the emulator, and entered: http://10.0.2.2:5000/

My web page showed up.

It was kind of slow, and it look a bit different than it shows on my desktop.

I browsed my application form my phone using the app created in heroku, and I could see the web site exactly as I see it on my laptop (pictures reamined the same size though).

I succesfully completed this assignment.
