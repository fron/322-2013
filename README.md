Welcome to CSE 322.

This course is structured as a sequence of assignments, which
involve reading, research, experimentation, configuation and
programming. For each assignment, you will create a folder within
your repository to store files you created to complete the
assignment. At a minimum, each assignment folder will contain a
file named README.md that includes information specific to the
assignment. Details about what to put in this file as well as
other files are provided in the instructions for the assignment.

After completing an assignment, you need to commit your new files
and changes to existing files into your local repository, and
then push these changes into your remote repository.
I will pull from your remote repository to get your files to
evaluate your work.

Before doing anything else, run the following commands to set
your name and email. Use your real name so I can recognize you
more easily.

    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email you@example.com
