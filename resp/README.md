[- Notes from responsive assignment:

In this assignment I learned about responsive website.

I first modified my website to make it responsive, it took quite some time to test it.

Then I used "Bootstrap" to re-create my website. It was a little bit confusing at the beginning,
but after some try and test, I get to test my website on a desktop, a laptop, and an android phone, and it worked nicely in all of them.

I succesfully completed this assignment
