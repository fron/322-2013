[- NOTES SECOND ANDROID ASSIGNMENT:

In this assignment I updated my JDK. installed ANT. 

I configured my phone for testing app

I verified the version is android-18

I created the project "hello"

I modified the file:  hello/AndroidManifest.xml including: <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="8" android:targetSdkVersion="18" /> as a child to the root.
I however, on this point had to change the app name as well (two instructions) for Hello322 on AndroidManifest.xml.

I modified in the file strings.xml the app name to Hello322 

I tested the app with the emulator: it installed an icon 322, at double click it displays: Hello 322

It didn't work with my phone. I found out that my laptop recognized my phone as a mass storage device. I updated the driver. It finally installed the app and I could see the "hello2 322" message on my phone.

I succesfully completed this assignment.
