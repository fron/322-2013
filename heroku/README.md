[- NOTES FROM SECOND ASSIGNMENT:

In this assignment I learned the basics of HEROKU:

I installed node.js, heroku on windows 7. Not a problem there
I created my index.html page
I created my main.js file
I created my HEROKU repository


I created my app, and I had problems when I pushed the app to the HEROKU repository
It seems that I had a conflict because I pushed twice with just one commit
