           <p class="history">
               Originally from South America, I moved to California to 
               pursue advancement on   my    IT   (Information and  
               Technology) career. On the side, photography is my  
               passion, so I’ve been shooting all around California for a 
               couple of years. 
               On fall 2013, I have to design a web site as part of one of  
               the subjects I’m taking at school, so, now there’s an  
               opportunity to show my pictures. This can be nothing but a  
               happy confluence of circumstances. 
               I hope you enjoy my pictures as much as I did creating them. &nbsp; 
               Feel free to drop me a line or two at:&nbsp
