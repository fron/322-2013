             Originally from South America, I moved to California to 
             pursue advancement on   my    IT   (Information and 
             Technology) career. On the side, photography is my 
             passion, so I’ve been shooting all around California for a 
             couple of years.<br> 
             On fall 2013, I have to design a web site as part of one of
             the subjects I’m taking at school, so, now there’s an 
             opportunity to show my pictures. This can be nothing but a
             happy confluence of circumstances.<br> 
             I hope you enjoy my pictures as much as I did creating them. &nbsp;
